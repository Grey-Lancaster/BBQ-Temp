      <li><a href="https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/assets/_site_/downloads/CH34x_Install_Mac_v1.5.zip" target="_blank">Mac OS Driver (CH340)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Unzip the downloaded file.</li>
    <li>Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.</li>
    <li>Once installed, reconnect your ESP32 and try flashing the firmware again.</li>
